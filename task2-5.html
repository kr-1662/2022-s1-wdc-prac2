        <h1>A page with some divs and spans</h1>
        <p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
        <p>Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".<br>
        This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span><span class="fancy"> and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span><br>
        because they belong to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
        <p>On the other hand<span class="blue fancy"> this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
